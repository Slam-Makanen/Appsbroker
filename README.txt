Hello!

Thank you very much for this challenge. It was the most fun I've had coding in a while!
This was my first ever attempt at architecting and building an environment from scratch, 
and on creating a design document, so please forgive me if the format is way off, or missing
a lot of expected detail (as I'm sure is the case)

Thanks again,
Will.
